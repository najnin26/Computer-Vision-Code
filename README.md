# Computer Vision Code 📸

Welcome to **Computer Vision Code**, a collection of Python scripts and notebooks demonstrating various computer vision techniques using OpenCV and related libraries.

This repository is designed for learners and developers to explore classic and practical computer vision concepts — from basic image processing to more advanced video and feature detection.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---
## 📂 Repository Contents

The project includes implementations of popular computer vision tasks such as:

- Edge detection (`Canny_edge_detection.py`)
- Background subtraction (`Background subtraction.py`)
- Feature detection & matching (`Corner Detection.py`, `Template_Matching.py`)
- Geometric transformations (`Perspective_Transformation.py`)
- Motion analysis (`Optical Flow.py`, `object_tracking.py`)
- Video stream handling (`Connect_Mobile_Camera.py`, `Video_from_youtube.py`)
- Image processing basics (blurring, thresholding, histogram, color spaces)
- …and many more utility demo scripts.

## 🚀 Features

This repo showcases:

- 🧠 **Basic image processing** — grayscale, thresholding, filtering  
- 📊 **Transformations** — resizing, perspective transforms, rotations  
- 🕵️ **Feature detection & analysis** — contours, edges, corners  
- 🎥 **Video and camera integration** — real-time camera feed and video file processing  
- 🌀 **Motion & tracking** — optical flow, object tracking  
- ⚙️ **Utility examples** for learning and experimentation

## 🧰 Tech Stack

This codebase is written in **Python** and primarily uses:

- 🔹 `OpenCV` — Computer vision and image/video processing  
- 🔹 `NumPy` — Efficient numerical operations  
- 🔹 `Jupyter Notebook` — For demo and interactive exploration

Ensure you have these tools installed to run the scripts.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
